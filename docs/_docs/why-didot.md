Introducing *Didot* - your ultimate command-line tool for seamless data-driven file generation! Imagine effortlessly transforming complex data into beautifully formatted outputs with just a single command.

Why Didot? Because it's designed with the modern developer in mind, handling multiple formats like YAML, JSON, and XML with ease. Whether you're working on configuration files, reports, or documentation, Didot takes your data and applies the perfect template to generate exactly what you need. No more switching between tools-Didot supports both Scriban and DotLiquid engines, giving you the power of choice and flexibility to craft the output that suits your project.

Need automation? Didot has you covered. With its versatile interface, you can plug it right into your CI/CD pipelines, or use it as a handy utility in your everyday workflow. And when input comes from dynamic sources, Didot adapts-allowing you to use standard input (StdIn) to keep things flowing.

From large-scale projects to personal tasks, Didot empowers you to create faster, smarter, and more efficiently. It's not just a tool-it's the bridge between your data and the perfect output, every time.
